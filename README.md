## Course opportunities

The university offers numerous paths to learn mapping and GIS, from a minor for undergraduates and graduate certificate for those with a bachelor's degree. The below list isn't comprehensive but shows many of the opportunities.

### GIS and Mapping - Minor
The College of Arts & Sciences [Department of Geography](https://geography.as.uky.edu/) offers a 18 hour (6 course) minor. The following three courses are required and form the foundation of the program's curriculum:

* GEO 109 - Digital Mapping OR GEO 164 - Worlds: Global Information Geographies [3 hours]
* GEO 309 - Introduction to GIS [3 hours]
* GEO 409 - Advanced GIS [3 hours]

### Graduate certificate in mapping
The Department of Geography's [New Maps Plus](http://newmapsplus.uky.edu) graduate programs at the University of Kentucky offer students a challenging, intensive, digital mapping curriculum that emphasizes the acquisition of technical skills—coding, GIS, web development—while also preparing students to critically address the complexity of today’s information ecosystem.

### Natural Resources and Environmental Science
An interdisciplinary degree program in the College of Agriculture has a strong focus on mapping. The main course in that program is:

* NRES 355 – Geographic Information Systems: Geospatial Apps for Land Analysis

### Mapshop

The Department of Geography's [Mapshop](http://newmaps.uky.edu/mapshop) provides an opportunity for community and campus organizations to work directly with students, faculty, and cartographic staff in the production of geographic representations. Mapshop is part of the larger University of Kentucky's [New Mappings Collaboratory](http://newmaps.uky.edu/) which is committed to innovations in mapping.


### Short courses

Occasionally we offer one-day instruction in various mapping technologies. Here is a past list of courses taught.
