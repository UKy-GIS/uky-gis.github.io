## Location

![Lexington, Kentucky](graphics/geogyall_v1.jpg)
Lexington is the second largest city in Kentucky and home to the University of Kentucky. This [aerial photograph from 1971](https://uky-gis.github.io/history/maps/1971/) shows central campus, the home of UK Geography.

## Geography Department's 75th Anniversary

We are celebrating our 75th Anniversary during the 2018-2019 school year. The Department of Geography was established in 1944 and is "ranked among leading geography graduate programs in the United States." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Geography,_University_of_Kentucky)) 

### Stories and maps

## Course opportunities

The university offers numerous paths to learn mapping and GIS, from a minor for undergraduates and graduate certificate for those with a bachelor's degree. The below list isn't comprehensive but shows many of the opportunities.

Examples from [GEO 409](courses/geo409)

### Master of Science (MS) and Graduate Certificate in in Digital Mapping
The Department of Geography's [New Maps Plus](http://newmapsplus.uky.edu) graduate programs at the University of Kentucky offer students a challenging, intensive, digital mapping curriculum that emphasizes the acquisition of technical skills—coding, GIS, web development—while also preparing students to critically address the complexity of today’s information ecosystem.

### Mapping and GIS - Undergraduate Minor
The College of Arts & Sciences Department of Geography offers a 18 hour (6 course) minor. The following three courses are required and form the foundation of the program's curriculum:

* [GEO 109](courses/geo109) - Digital Mapping OR GEO 164 - Worlds: Global Information Geographies [3 hours]
* [GEO 309](courses/geo309) - Introduction to GIS [3 hours]
* [GEO 409](courses/geo409) - Advanced GIS [3 hours]

### Mapshop

The Department of Geography's [Mapshop](http://newmaps.uky.edu/mapshop) provides an opportunity for community and campus organizations to work directly with students, faculty, and cartographic staff in the production of geographic representations. Mapshop is part of the larger University of Kentucky's [New Mappings Collaboratory](http://newmaps.uky.edu/) which is committed to innovations in mapping.

### Short courses

Occasionally we offer one-day instruction in various mapping technologies. Here is a past list of courses taught.
