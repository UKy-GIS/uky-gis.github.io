# GEO409: Advanced GIS

This course is developed to introduce intermediate and advanced topics in geographic information science and spatial analysis including theoretical and application areas. Building upon a range of GIS software systems this course covers geographic data collection, entry and editing, spatial analysis, interpolation, and map development and display.

In Spring 2019, we will explore Kentucky's lidar dataset recently made available for the entire state. The lidar data model encodes 3D position as a point in a massive point cloud. A single point can have attributes that represent an object's type like ground, vegetation, and building top. In a GIS, we render point clouds as digital surface models where we can measure and analyze features in three dimensions.
