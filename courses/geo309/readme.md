# GEO309: Introduction to GIS and Mapping

This course introduces students to the use of geographic information systems and their basic principles. Topics addressed include data collection, processing and output. Students will learn about types of geographic information and data: sources, constraints, and uses; the range of secondary spatial data sets available; and the collection of primary spatial data using global positioning systems (GPS) and other technologies.

## Essential skills/topics

* General data model. How are geographic entities stored as data?
    * Tabular, vector, and raster data models
    * Understanding scale and resolution of data
    * Common file formats and intro to QGIS

* Coordinate reference systems
    * Geographic and projected coordinates 
    * Types of distortion in projections
    * Selecting a general set of projections based on scale and purpose
    * Moving between coordinate systems in QGIS

* Elements of map design
    * Thematic and reference maps
    * Visual variables and levels of measurement
    * Basic color theory, visual hierarchy, and label placement
    * Creating and exporting a layout in QGIS

* Choropleth mapping
    * Normalizing data
    * Classification schemes
    * Proportional symbols
    * Evaluation of population density

* Attribute analysis
    * Select by attribute
    * Using Postgres/PostGIS with QGIS
    * Common table operations using SQL
    * Attribute joins and field calculations
    
* Vector Geoprocessing
    * Select by location
    * Buffer, clip, intersect, and dissolve
    * Spatial joins
    * Vector overlay analysis

* Using raster data
    * Common types of raster, integer, imaging, and continuous
    * Digitizing features from aerial photos
    * DEM derivatives
    * Basic Map Algebra analysis

* Common data sources and map tools
    * Local, Kentucky, and national data sources
    * Comparing QGIS and ArcGIS Pro with analysis


* This course should introduce both QGIS and ArcGIS Pro, with Q being the primary software. Since it is free and runs on a Mac, students will have a useful tool if they decide not to continue to GEO409. Students will use ArcGIS Pro with a one-year license from ESRI. Upon becoming a Mapping and GIS minor, the student can receive an institutional license for their duration in school.
